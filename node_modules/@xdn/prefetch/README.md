# XDN Prefetch

Prefetching library for the [Moovweb XDN](https://developer.moovweb.com), infrastructure to run your big, dynamic website frontend and make it load in less than one second.

The `@xdn/prefetch` package makes it easy to prefetch dynamic content cached at the network edge and store it in the browser's service worker cache. 

You can read more about it in our [prefetching guide](https://developer.moovweb.com/guides/prefetching)
